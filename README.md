# NetCDF Postprocessor(s)
This repository contains a tangle of code I have used to process NetCDF files for my PhD project. Especially the earlier parts were written to be reusable, but as time became more constrained my software discipline lapsed. With some effort put into refactoring I think this could be useful at some point.
